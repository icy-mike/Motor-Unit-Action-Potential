Motor unit action potential
===========================
This is a motor unit action potential model written in MATLAB for BME 4641, Bioelectricity.  The model is based upon the dipole representation of an action potential.  The figures generated are for (1) a single dipole model with a depolarizing dipole and (2) a two dipole model with a depolarizing and hyperpolarizing dipole.
